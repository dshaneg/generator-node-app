<%= description %>

## Usage

Describe how to use your application.

## Development

[Visual Studio Code] is the recommended editor, though you are free to use what you like. The project is set
up to make life easy for VS Code-wielding developers.

To pass muster for deployment, the code must pass through the [ESLint] gauntlet. We are using a slightly relaxed
variant of the [air-bnb] ruleset.

## Deployment

Describe how your application is deployed.
